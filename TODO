TODO:
Things to handle, sort of in order.

- nail down desired features (see description document)
- figure out which versions of Android to support (some things easier with newer versions - see https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/volumeshaper req. API 26)
- figure out what exactly we are using the database for
    (local seems easier - store projects/tracks/effects in single database, export to single audio file on demand?)
- figure out how to play & record audio at the same time
- figure out audio codecs to support for import/export (see https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats - are these already supported to get audio out of/convert between?)
- lay out UI
